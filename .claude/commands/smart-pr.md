# Smart Pull Request

AI-powered pull request creation with automatic summary and description generation.

**Module**: Git (standalone, works without PRDs)
**Usage**: Lightweight projects, open source contributions, quick PRs

---

## Instructions

You are tasked with creating an intelligent pull request with a clear summary, description, and testing checklist.

### Steps

1. **Verify Git state**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git branch --show-current
   ```

   Requirements:
   - Must be on a feature branch (not main/master)
   - Branch should have commits
   - Optionally: branch should be pushed to remote

2. **Analyze commits** since branch diverged from main:
   ```bash
   # Get base branch (main or master)
   BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')

   # Get all commits in this branch
   git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline

   # Get diff summary
   git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --stat

   # Get full diff for analysis
   git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD
   ```

3. **Generate PR content**:

   **Title**: Clear, concise (50-72 chars)
   - Use conventional commit format: `<type>: <description>`
   - Examples:
     - `feat: Add user authentication with OAuth2`
     - `fix: Resolve memory leak in data processing`
     - `docs: Update API documentation with new endpoints`

   **Summary**: 2-4 bullet points of main changes

   **Description**: Include:
   - What changed and why
   - Implementation approach
   - Any design decisions made
   - Breaking changes (if any)
   - Screenshots/demos (if UI changes)

   **Test Plan**: Checklist of how to test the changes

4. **Push branch if needed**:
   ```bash
   # Check if branch is pushed
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null

   # If not pushed:
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

5. **Create PR using GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --title "PR Title" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary

   - Main change 3

### Configuration

Respects `git.smart_pr` configuration:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "smart_pr": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ai_summary_generation": true,
      "auto_link_issues": true,

### Options

User can provide context:

```
/smart-pr
/smart-pr This PR adds the new payment integration
/smart-pr [closes: #42, #43] Fixes login and signup bugs
```

### Error Handling

- **Not on feature branch**: "Create a feature branch first. You're on main/master."
- **No commits**: "No commits to create PR from. Make commits first."
- **Not pushed**: "Branch not pushed. Push first? (Will do automatically)"
- **PR already exists**: "PR already exists: [URL]"
- **GitHub CLI not available**: "Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/"

### Best Practices

- âœ… Clear, descriptive title
- âœ… Structured summary and description
- âœ… Comprehensive test plan
- âœ… Links to related issues
- âœ… Screenshots for UI changes
- âœ… Breaking changes highlighted
- âœ… Checklist for reviewers

### Integration

Works seamlessly with:
- **Conventional Commits**: Parses commit messages to generate PR title
- **Issue Linking**: Auto-detects issue references in commits
- **Semantic Release**: Compatible with semantic versioning
- **GitHub Actions**: Can trigger CI/CD workflows
