## Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0-10 min)

```markdown
## Detection Sources
- ‚úÖ Automated alerts (Datadog, Sentry, PagerDuty)
- ‚úÖ Customer reports (support tickets, social media)
- ‚úÖ Monitoring dashboards (sudden spikes/drops)
- ‚úÖ Team observation (manual testing)

## Triage Questions
1. How many users affected? (all, >50%, <10%)
2. What functionality is broken? (core vs secondary)
3. Is data at risk? (data loss, corruption, breach)
4. What is the business impact? (revenue, reputation)
5. Is it still happening? (ongoing vs resolved)

## Severity Assignment
- All users + core feature = SEV0
- >50% users OR core feature = SEV1
- <10% users AND secondary feature = SEV2
- Cosmetic only = SEV3
```

---

### Phase 2: Investigation (10-30 min)

**Checklist**:
```markdown
## Recent Changes (Last 2 Hours)
- [ ] Check recent deployments (git log, CI/CD pipeline)
- [ ] Check infrastructure changes (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- [ ] Check configuration changes (feature flags, env vars)
- [ ] Check dependency updates (package.json, requirements.txt)

## Monitoring & Logs
- [ ] Error rate spike? (compare to baseline)
- [ ] Latency spike? (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Traffic spike? (DDoS, viral content)
- [ ] Database slow queries? (pg_stat_statements)
- [ ] Third-party API issues? (payment, auth, email)

## Infrastructure Health
- [ ] Cloud provider status (AWS, GCP, Azure status pages)
- [ ] CPU/Memory usage (check autoscaling limits)
- [ ] Disk space (database, logs)
- [ ] Network connectivity (DNS, CDN)
```

**Common Root Causes** (80% of incidents):
1. **Recent deploy** (40%) ‚Üí Rollback
2. **Database issue** (20%) ‚Üí Slow queries, connection pool exhausted
3. **Third-party API down** (15%) ‚Üí Timeout, fallback to degraded mode
4. **Infrastructure limit** (10%) ‚Üí Scale up, increase quotas
5. **Configuration error** (10%) ‚Üí Revert config, fix env vars
6. **Security attack** (5%) ‚Üí Block IPs, enable rate limiting

---

### Phase 3: Mitigation (30-60 min)

**Decision Tree**:
```
Is it a recent deploy?
  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Rollback to previous version (fastest path)
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Continue...

Is it a database issue?
  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Kill slow queries, scale up, add indexes
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Continue...

Is it a third-party API?
  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Enable circuit breaker, fallback mode
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Continue...

Is it a capacity issue?
  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Scale up instances, increase limits
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Continue...

Unknown?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Enable degraded mode (disable non-critical features)
```

**Rollback Procedure**:
```bash
# 1. Identify last working version
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Rollback deployment
git revert <commit-sha>
git push origin main

# 3. Trigger CI/CD deploy
# (or manual deploy if CI/CD broken)

# 4. Verify service restored
curl https://api.example.com/health
# Expected: 200 OK

# 5. Monitor error rate for 10 minutes
# If stable ‚Üí incident resolved
# If not stable ‚Üí continue investigation
```

### Phase 4: Communication

**Status Page Template**:
```markdown
## Incident Report: {Title}

**Status**: Investigating | Identified | Monitoring | Resolved
**Severity**: SEV0 | SEV1 | SEV2 | SEV3
**Started**: Jan 26, 2025 12:00 PM UTC
**Impact**: {Description of user-facing impact}

### Updates

**12:30 PM UTC** - Monitoring
We have identified the root cause as a recent deployment and rolled back to the previous version. Error rates are returning to normal. We are monitoring the situation.

**12:15 PM UTC** - Identified
We have identified the issue as a bug introduced in the 12:00 PM deployment affecting user authentication. We are rolling back the deployment.

**12:05 PM UTC** - Investigating
We are aware of an issue causing users to be unable to log in. Our engineering team is investigating.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Schedule postmortem for Jan 27, 2025 at 2:00 PM
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks to prevent recurrence
```

**Stakeholder Communication Template**:
```markdown
## To: Executive Team
**Subject**: SEV1 Incident - Login Outage Resolved

**Summary**:
We experienced a login outage from 12:00-12:30 PM UTC affecting approximately 60% of users attempting to log in. The issue was caused by a bug in the authentication service deployed at 12:00 PM. We rolled back the deployment at 12:20 PM and service was restored by 12:30 PM.

**Impact**:
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Users affected: ~5,000 (60% of active users)
- Revenue impact: $2,500 (estimated lost transactions)

**Root Cause**:
A bug in the JWT token validation logic introduced in commit abc123 caused tokens to be rejected as invalid.

**Resolution**:
Rolled back to previous version (commit def456) and verified authentication working correctly.

**Prevention**:
1. Add integration tests for authentication flows
2. Enable canary deployments (10% traffic for 10 min before full rollout)
3. Add circuit breaker to auth service

**Postmortem**:
Scheduled for Jan 27, 2025 at 2:00 PM (meeting link)
```

### Phase 5: Postmortem (Blameless)

**Template**:
```markdown
# Postmortem: {Incident Title}

**Date**: Jan 26, 2025
**Severity**: SEV1
**Duration**: 30 minutes (12:00-12:30 PM UTC)
**Impact**: 60% of users unable to log in

---

## What Happened?

A bug in the JWT token validation logic was introduced in commit abc123, deployed at 12:00 PM UTC. The bug caused all authentication tokens to be rejected as invalid, preventing users from logging in.

---

## Timeline (All Times UTC)

| Time  | Event |
|-------|-------|
| 12:00 PM | Deploy commit abc123 to production |
| 12:02 PM | First customer report of login issues |
| 12:05 PM | On-call engineer paged, incident channel created |
| 12:10 PM | Root cause identified: JWT validation bug |
| 12:15 PM | Decision to rollback deployment |
| 12:20 PM | Rollback deployed |
| 12:30 PM | Service restored, error rate back to normal |
| 12:45 PM | Incident declared resolved |

---

## Root Cause

The bug was introduced in the `validateToken()` function:

```diff
- if (token.exp > Date.now() / 1000) {
+ if (token.exp < Date.now() / 1000) {
```

The comparison operator was reversed (< instead of >), causing all tokens to be treated as expired.

---

## What Went Well? ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Incident detected within 2 minutes (customer report)
- ‚úÖ On-call engineer responded in 3 minutes
- ‚úÖ Root cause identified quickly (10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Rollback executed smoothly (10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Communication was clear and frequent

---

## What Went Poorly? ‚ùå

- ‚ùå Bug not caught in pre-production testing
- ‚ùå No integration tests for authentication flow
- ‚ùå Deploy went to 100% of users immediately (no canary)
- ‚ùå No automated rollback on error rate spike

---

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Add integration tests for JWT validation | @alice | Feb 1 | In Progress |
| Enable canary deployments (10% for 10 min) | @bob | Feb 5 | Not Started |
| Add automated rollback on error rate > 5% | @charlie | Feb 10 | Not Started |
| Update code review checklist (auth changes) | @diana | Jan 28 | Completed |

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Testing**: Integration tests for critical paths (auth, payment) are non-negotiable
2. **Deployment**: Canary deployments would have limited impact to 10% of users
3. **Automation**: Automated rollback on error spikes would have reduced downtime by 50%
4. **Monitoring**: Need better alerting on authentication failures (not just error rate)
```

## Incident Prevention Strategies

### 1. Deployment Safety

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Canary deployment
- name: Deploy canary (10% traffic)
  run: kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:${{ github.sha }}
  environment: production-canary

- name: Monitor canary (10 minutes)
  run: |
    sleep 600
    ERROR_RATE=$(get_error_rate)
    if [ $ERROR_RATE -gt 1 ]; then
      echo "Canary failed, rolling back"
      kubectl rollout undo deployment/app
      exit 1
    fi

- name: Deploy to 100%
  run: kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:${{ github.sha }}
  environment: production
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern

```typescript
// Protect against third-party API failures
import CircuitBreaker from 'opossum';

const options = {
  timeout: 3000,        // Timeout after 3s
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,  // Open circuit if >50% fail
  resetTimeout: 30000   // Try again after 30s
};

const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(callPaymentAPI, options);

breaker.fallback(() => {
  // Fallback: queue payment for later processing
  return { status: 'queued', message: 'Payment will be processed shortly' };
});

breaker.on('open', () => {
  // Alert team when circuit opens
  alerting.send('Payment API circuit breaker opened');
});

export async function processPayment(amount, userId) {
  return breaker.fire(amount, userId);
}
```

### 3. Feature Flags

```typescript
// Gracefully disable features during incidents
import { LaunchDarkly } from 'launchdarkly-node-server-sdk';

const client = LaunchDarkly.init(process.env.LAUNCHDARKLY_KEY);

// In your code
if (await client.variation('enable-comments', user, false)) {
  // Comments feature enabled
  return renderComments();
} else {
  // Comments disabled (during incident)
  return renderMessage('Comments temporarily unavailable');
}

// During incident: toggle feature flag via dashboard
// No deploy required!
```

---

## Configuration

Respects these settings:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "incident_coordinator": {
      "enabled": true,
      "auto_create_incident_channel": true,
      "severity_levels": ["SEV0", "SEV1", "SEV2", "SEV3"],
      "notification_channels": {
        "SEV0": ["slack", "pagerduty", "email", "sms"],
        "SEV1": ["slack", "pagerduty"],
        "SEV2": ["slack"],
        "SEV3": []
      },
      "postmortem_required": ["SEV0", "SEV1"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Success Criteria

- Incidents detected within 5 minutes
- SEV0 incidents resolved within 1 hour (90% of cases)
- All SEV0/SEV1 incidents have postmortems
- Action items from postmortems completed within 30 days
