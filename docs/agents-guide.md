# Agents Guide

Guide to the 6 specialized AI agents in PRD Workflow Manager.

## Agent Overview

| Agent | Expertise | Auto-Invoked By |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| `prd-reviewer` | PRD quality & feasibility | `/review-prd` |
| `prd-implementer` | Development guidance | `/work-prd` |
| `orchestrator` | Workflow coordination | `/orchestrate` |
| `security-expert` | Security & compliance | `/security-audit` |
| `quality-assurance` | Code quality & testing | `/quality-check` |

## How Agents Work

Agents are specialized AI personalities with domain expertise. They:
- Provide expert analysis and guidance
- Follow proven methodologies
- Generate actionable recommendations
- Maintain consistent tone and standards

**Invocation**: Agents are automatically invoked by their corresponding commands. You interact with them through the command interface.

## Agent Communication

### Tone & Style

All agents follow these principles:
- **Professional**: Expert but not condescending
- **Actionable**: Specific recommendations, not vague advice
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge strengths before gaps
- **Educational**: Explain "why" not just "what"

### Example Interaction

```
You: /review-prd

PRD Reviewer (Agent):
üìä PRD Review: Design System v1.0

Overall Assessment:
Well-structured with clear components. Scope is ambitious for v1.0
and could benefit from lotification. Missing performance requirements.

Grade: B (82%)
Recommendation: Needs minor work before approval

üéØ 1. Clarity & Scope - Grade: B+

Strengths:
‚úÖ Clear component structure
‚úÖ Well-defined IN vs OUT scope

Questions:
1. Could we defer theme customization to v1.1?
2. What's the absolute MVP for v1.0?
...

[Continues with all 7 dimensions]

CRITICAL QUESTIONS (Answer These):
1. Scope: Can we ship 50% of components in v1.0?
2. Tech: Have you tested shadcn/ui setup locally?
...
```

## Customizing Agent Behavior

### Strictness Levels (PRD Reviewer)

**Lenient** (Startup):
- Minimum grade: D
- Fewer calibration questions
- Faster approval

**Balanced** (Default):
- Minimum grade: C
- Standard questions
- Thorough review

**Strict** (Enterprise):
- Minimum grade: B
- Comprehensive questions
- Rigorous review

### Task Granularity (PRD Implementer)

**Fine** (Junior developers):
- 1 task = 30min-1h
- Very detailed steps
- 10-20 tasks per feature

**Medium** (Default):
- 1 task = 1-3h
- Moderate detail
- 5-10 tasks per feature

**Coarse** (Senior developers):
- 1 task = 0.5-1 day
- High-level guidance
- 3-5 tasks per feature

## Best Practices

### 1. Trust the Agents

‚úÖ **DO**: Follow agent recommendations
```
Security Expert: "High: Hardcoded API key"
You: Fix immediately ‚úÖ
```

‚ùå **DON'T**: Ignore critical warnings
```
You: "I'll fix it later" ‚ùå
```

### 2. Provide Context When Asked

‚úÖ **DO**: Thoughtful answers
```
Agent: "Can we defer dark mode to v1.1?"
You: "Yes, analytics show <5% users use dark mode"
```

‚ùå **DON'T**: Dismissive answers
```
You: "Maybe" or "I don't know"
```

### 3. Iterate Based on Feedback

‚úÖ **DO**: Continuous improvement
```
Quality Agent: "Test coverage 65% (target: 80%)"
You: Add tests ‚Üí Re-run ‚Üí 82% ‚úÖ
```
