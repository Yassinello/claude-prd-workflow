## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-25

### 🎉 Major Release: Modular Architecture & Lightweight Mode

This release introduces a **modular architecture** that makes the plugin flexible for different project types - from full PRD workflows to lightweight Git helpers.

### Added

#### New Modes
- **Full Mode**: Complete PRD workflow (default, same as v1.x)
- **Lightweight Mode**: No PRDs, just Git helpers + quality checks (perfect for side projects!)
- **Skills-only Mode**: Just reusable skills for custom workflows (planned for v2.1)

#### New Commands
- `/plugin-version` - Check installed version vs. latest, with update instructions
- `/smart-commit` - AI-powered commit message generation (Conventional Commits)
- `/smart-pr` - AI-powered PR creation with auto-generated summary and test plan

#### Configuration
- `mode` setting: Choose between "full", "lightweight", or "skills-only"
- `modules` configuration: Enable/disable specific modules (prd, quality, security, git, devops, orchestration)
- New preset: `lightweight.json` for projects that don't use PRDs
- Git workflow configuration: `smart_commit` and `smart_pr` settings

#### Documentation
- `docs/use-cases.md` - Complete guide for different project types
- `docs/version-check.md` - How to check and update plugin version
- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `dev/` directory for developer documentation

#### Developer Experience
- `.plugin-info.json` created during installation with version metadata
- Updated `install.js` to display `/plugin-version` command in success message
- Better installation output with version info

### Changed

#### **BREAKING**: Project structure reorganized
- **MOVED**: `CLAUDE.md` → `dev/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- **MOVED**: `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` → `dev/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
- **MOVED**: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` → `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- **CREATED**: `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Why**: Clear separation between user docs (README, docs/) and developer docs (dev/, .github/)

#### Configuration Schema Enhanced
- Added `mode` field (enum: full, lightweight, skills-only)
- Added `modules` section for granular module control
- Each module can be independently enabled/disabled

### Migration Guide

#### From v1.x to v2.0.0

**No config changes required!** v2.0.0 defaults to "full" mode, same as v1.x.

However, if you want to use new features:

#### Option 1: Use Lightweight Mode (for side projects)
```json
{
  "preset": "lightweight"
}
```

Or manually:
```json
{
  "mode": "lightweight",
  "modules": {
    "prd": false,
    "git": true,
    "quality": true,
    "security": true
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Stay in Full Mode (default)
No changes needed. All v1.x features work exactly as before.

#### Updating References
If you have scripts or documentation referencing:
- `CLAUDE.md` → Update to `dev/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` → Update to `dev/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` → Update to `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

### Use Cases

v2.0.0 supports **5 main use cases**:

1. **Startup with PRDs** → Use `startup.json` preset (full mode)
2. **Side project without PRDs** → Use `lightweight.json` preset
3. **Open source project** → Use `open-source.json` preset (full mode)
4. **Enterprise team** → Use `enterprise.json` preset (full mode)
5. **Solo developer** → Use `lightweight.json` with minimal modules

See `docs/use-cases.md` for detailed configuration examples.

### New Commands Overview

#### `/plugin-version`
Quickly check if you're running the latest version:
```
/plugin-version
→ Installed: 1.2.0
→ Latest: 2.0.0
→ Update available! Run: npm install -g claude-prd-workflow@latest
```

#### `/smart-commit` (Lightweight Mode)
AI-generated commit messages following Conventional Commits:
```
/smart-commit
→ Analyzes your changes
→ Generates: "feat(auth): Add OAuth2 login with Google"
→ Creates commit
```

#### `/smart-pr` (Lightweight Mode)
AI-generated PR with summary, description, and test plan:
```
/smart-pr
→ Analyzes commits since branch diverged
→ Generates comprehensive PR description
→ Creates PR on GitHub
→ Returns PR URL
```

### Technical Changes

- Enhanced `config/schema.json` with mode and modules definitions
- Created `config/presets/lightweight.json` for non-PRD workflows
- Updated `install.js` to create `.plugin-info.json` metadata file
- File reorganization with `git mv` to preserve history

### What's Next (v2.1.0 Planned)

- **Full modular architecture**: Physical separation of modules into `modules/` directory
- **Skills-only mode**: Use skills without commands
- **Custom workflow composer**: Create your own commands using skills
- **CLI tool**: Standalone CLI independent of Claude Code
