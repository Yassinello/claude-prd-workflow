# Review PRD Command

Conduct a comprehensive PRD review following structured methodology.

## Purpose

Review and validate PRDs before development starts, ensuring quality, feasibility, and completeness.

## Workflow

### Step 1: List Draft PRDs

Scan the draft PRD directory (default: `product/prds/01-draft/`) for available PRD files.

Display a table of available PRDs:

```markdown
üìã **PRDs Available for Review (01-draft/)**

| # | PRD File | Feature Name | Priority | Grade |
|---|----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | 251024-design-system-v1.md | Design System | P0 | B |
| 2 | 251024-landing-page-v1.md | Landing Page | P0 | C+ |
| 3 | 251024-analytics-v1.md | Analytics | P1 | D |

Which PRD would you like to review? (1-3 or filename)
```

### Step 2: Move to Review Folder

Once user selects, move PRD from `01-draft/` to `02-review/`.

### Step 3: Analyze PRD (7 Dimensions)

Review the PRD across these dimensions:

1. **Clarity & Scope** üéØ
   - Is the problem clearly defined?
   - Is the scope well-bounded (IN vs OUT)?
   - Are edge cases considered?

2. **Technical Feasibility** ‚öôÔ∏è
   - Is the tech stack appropriate?
   - Are there technical risks?
   - Do we have the required expertise?

3. **User Experience** üßë‚Äçüíª
   - Is the user journey clear?
   - Are wireframes/mockups provided?
   - Is accessibility considered?

4. **Dependencies & Blockers** üöß
   - What features does this depend on?
   - What features are waiting for this?
   - Are there any hard blockers?

5. **Acceptance Criteria** ‚úÖ
   - Are criteria specific and measurable?
   - Can we verify completion objectively?
   - Are non-functional requirements included?

6. **Risk Assessment** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are mitigation strategies?
   - Is there a rollback plan?

7. **Simplification Opportunities** ü™ì
   - Can we ship 50% of this in v1.0?
   - What's the absolute MVP?
   - Can we defer complexity?

### Step 4: Generate Summary + Critical Questions

Output a comprehensive review with:
- Overall assessment and grade (A-F)
- Strengths and gaps for each dimension
- 5-10 critical questions that MUST be answered
- Recommendations for improvement

### Step 5: Wait for User Answers

Do NOT proceed until user responds to the critical questions.

### Step 6: Apply Changes

Based on answers:
1. Summarize proposed changes
2. Wait for approval
3. Update PRD in place (same file in `02-review/`)
4. Update WORK_PLAN.md (if enabled in config)

### Step 7: Grade & Recommend

Show before/after grade and recommend next steps:
- If grade improved to A/B: recommend approval
- If still C/D: recommend more refinement
- If grade declined: identify what went wrong

### Step 8: Handle Approval

If user says "approve":
1. Move PRD to `03-ready/`
2. Create GitHub Issue (if configured)
3. Update WORK_PLAN.md
4. Provide next steps

## Configuration

Uses these config settings:
```json
{
  "prd_workflow": {
    "directories": {
      "draft": "product/prds/01-draft",
      "review": "product/prds/02-review",
      "ready": "product/prds/03-ready"
    },
    "review": {
      "dimensions": [...],
      "grading_enabled": true,
      "minimum_grade": "C",
      "calibration_questions": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

- PRD moves from C/D to A/B grade
- All critical gaps identified and filled
- User consciously approves moving to development
- GitHub issue created (if configured)

## Related

- Agent: `prd-reviewer` (automatically invoked)
- Skills: `estimation`, `documentation`
- Next Command: `/code-prd` (start development)
